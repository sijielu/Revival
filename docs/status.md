### Project Summary

### Approach
In this project, we use CycleGAN. CycleGAN was introduced in the paper from UC Berekey, "Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks". CycleGAN is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that uses two generators and two discriminators. Let's denote that $$X$$ is the domain of Minecraft images and $$Y$$ is the domain of real-world images. The generator $$G$$ converts images from domain $$$$ to domain $$Y$$, and the generator $$F$$ converts images from domain $$Y$$ to domain $$X$$: 
$$\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v~dx = \int_\Omega fv~dx$$

### Project Summary

### Approaches
#### 1. Introduction
- **Image-to-Image Translation**  
Image-to-image translation is the task of taking images from one domain and transforming them so they have the style (or characteristics) of images from another domain. 
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**  
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieved huge successes in image editing, image generation, and many other areas. GANs, introduced by Ian Goodfellow and other researchers at the Université de Montréal in 2014, are a type of neural networks based on the idea of adversarial training, where two neural networks, generator and discriminator, contest with each other. 
- **Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGANs)**

#### 2. Formulation
- **Adversarial Loss**
For Generator $G$
- **Cycle Consistency Loss**
- **Identity Mapping Loss**

### **Summary of the Project**

### **AI/ML Algorithms**
For our project, we plan to use generative adversarial network (GAN) to build our machine learning system. Specifically, we would like to utilize CycleGAN.

### **Evaluation Plan**
To determine the success of our project, we will evaluate our machine learning system both quantitatively and qualitatively:
* Quantitative Evaluation

* Qualitative Evaluation

### **Appointment with the Instructor**
9:30am on Monday, April 29 (DBH 4204)

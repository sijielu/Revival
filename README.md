We aim at converting the scenes in Minecraft to the pictures of the real world. As we know Minecraft uses blocks with different colors to present different scenes such as forest, river, cliff, desert and ocean. In this project we build the model to learn from the screenshots of the scenes in Minecraft and create pictures akin to that of the real world objects.
